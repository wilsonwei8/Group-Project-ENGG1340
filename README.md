  In this game, you can not only play with your family and friend, but also play against a powerful AI. you'll have to be very careful because the AI will analyze your decisions and play against you just like a person would. Exciting innovation!!! You can fight against AI in a randomly breathtaking endgame.(ps: None of our group members have won the AI, maybe you can be the first one!)

Thanks for spending time on our game! Joy and pride swelled inside us when the AI we created beat us. This work might not be that perfect, with many possible errors that we failed to detect. But we can promise that we have tried our best to make it better!
